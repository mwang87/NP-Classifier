What we need to do is convert keras hdf5 model to tensor flow model. 

1. Make sure you have tensorflow installed
1. Download Model with . ./get_models.sh
1. Create folder SUPERCLASS/000001
1. Create folder CLASS/000001
1. Create folder PATHWAY/000001
1. Convert from keras -> tf model
1. Place model in appropriate folder also in versioned folder SUPERCLASS/000001
1. Place model in appropriate folder also in versioned folder CLASS/000001
1. Place model in appropriate folder also in versioned folder PATHWAY/000001

Note: to get the model metadata, go to ```/model/metadata```
